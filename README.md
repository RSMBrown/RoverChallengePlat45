# RoverChallengePlat45

Hi! 
Thank you for taking the time to review my code - not sure if i added this stuff correctly to Github (first time using it) 
but I hope that you can fully explore what I have done for this challenge.

I tried to add as many comments as possible so that it was clear (it kind of looked more messy to me, but I thought it would be advantageous to do so.) 

The output works using the cuurent input and I tried many other variations along the way.

I tried to use unit testing but really struggled to get that going, in order to test my code, 
I just used print statments to make sure that i was getting the correct input to an output.

I added an extra input which was "how many rovers would you like to change?" so that I could have an input for the for loop for how many times to repeats the rovers position and movement questions.

I really struggled with the grid but I am glad that it's working - there were many things to consider like code starting at 0 instead of 1 and having to reverse the rows so that (0, 0) would be in the botting left instead of the top left.

I am sure will discuss in detail at some point. I look forward to do so.
